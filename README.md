SVG utilities for Adobe Illustrator
=================

This place is were I intend to publish various scripts I use for working with SVG in Adobe Illustrator.

## Layers-to-SVG.jsx

A simple scripts which exports each layer as a separate SVG file.

The extension prompts the user for an output folder in which each layer will be exported as a properly scaled SVG file named after the layer.
